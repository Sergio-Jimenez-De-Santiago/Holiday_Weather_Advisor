# About
Holiday Weather Advisor Imagine a user is considering two alternative holiday destinations (e.g. Dingle or Derry; Chamonix or Zermatt) and they would like to get some comparative information on what to expect weather-wise. The objective for this project would be to build an app that would meet this requirement based on data scraped from weather resources on the internet. Version 1: A basic version of the application would accept the two alternative destinations as input along with the proposed travel dates and would present expected temperature and rainfall amounts based on historic data scraped from weather sources on the web. Version 2: A more advanced version would present a more in-depth analysis. For instance it might present information based on historic distributions rather than means. For example, the mean maximum temperature might be 26 C, what is the probability of days with temperatures over 35 C? Or for rainfall, what is the risk of having rain most days?
